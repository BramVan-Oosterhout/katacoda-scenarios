<!-- Scenario text goes here -->
In this scenario we will inspect two components of the wiki work bench: 
* RenderSimpleTopicCreator
* RenderTopicInstaller

The wiki work bench is a well developed wiki application. By inspecting it we will see a number of techniques that are useful when you build your own applications.

This scenario is explanatory rather than exploratory. Many of the examples are presented in the Foswiki Sandbox. That allows us to demonstrate the implementation.

This approach should not discourage you from experimenting with the components presented. Feel free to modify any of the examples to experiment. The solutions will include a "reset' instruction so you can undo all your changes if desired. 

To start you should open the topic (https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/Applications.RenderSimpleTopicCreator)[Applications.RenderSimpleTopicCreator] in a separate window or tab, so you can reference it as parts of the implementation are explained.
