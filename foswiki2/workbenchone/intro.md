<!-- Scenario text goes here -->
In this scenario we will inspect two components of the wiki work bench: 
* RenderSimpleTopicCreator
* RenderTopicInstaller

The wiki work bench is a well developed wiki application. By inspecting some components we will see a number of techniques that are useful when you build your own applications.

This scenario is explanatory rather than exploratory. Many of the examples are presented in the Foswiki Sandbox. That allows us to demonstrate the implementation in action, rather than static examples.

This approach should not discourage you from experimenting with the components presented. Feel free to modify any of the examples to experiment. The solutions will include a "reset' instruction so you can undo all your changes if desired. Or you can restart the scenario to refresh completely.

Throughout this scenario we will be referring to Foswiki macros. These are normally identified by surrounding them with percent (%) marks. For readability this scenario omits the percent marks where the macro is references in the plain text. Code blocks will show the complete code, including percent marks.
