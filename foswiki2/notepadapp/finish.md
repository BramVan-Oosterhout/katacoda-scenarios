 Congratulations! You have seen some of the tools used to build a wiki application.

 As pointed out during the course there are alternative ways to build this application. Feel free to experiment.

 Presentation is a big part of a successful application and styling can help a lot to achieve that. In this course we used the `pattern` skin, because it displays many links useful in developing applications. As you have seen in the development of the [NotePadApp](http://cdlhttps://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/KatacodaCourses/Foswiki2/NotePadApp/NotePadApp?topicparent=KatacodaCourses/Foswiki2/NotePadApp.ScenarioFinish "Create this topic"), few are needed in the operation of a single app. A modern looking skin, the `nat` skin is more attractive for end users and you should try the [NotePadApp](http://cdlhttps://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/KatacodaCourses/Foswiki2/NotePadApp/NotePadApp?topicparent=KatacodaCourses/Foswiki2/NotePadApp.ScenarioFinish "Create this topic") with `SKIN=nat`

 Applications can be distributed via the Foswiki site as contributions, `Contrib`s for short. See: [Foswiki BuildContribCookbook](https://foswiki.org/Development.BuildContribCookbook). Packaging is a topic in itself. If you are interested, post a request in the Foswiki discussion group: <https://lists.foswiki.org/wws/lists> using email to: [foswiki-discuss@lists.foswiki.org](mailto:foswiki-discuss@lists.foswiki.org).

 Happy experimentation!
