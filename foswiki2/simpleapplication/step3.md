Our _ExampleApp_ will support topics with specific data. In the previous step we defined to form that defined that data.
The wiki work bench refers to topics that are associated with a particular set of fields as topic of that **type**

To develop a button that will create a topic of a particular type, we use the TopicType wiki work bench link.
After selecting the link, you are presented with a _New_ button. Click it and complete the details for the new TopicType.
The Title is: _ExampleType_ and you can add a short description. Click _Submit_ and you will be presented with a sample
TopicType definition. Save the sample.

There are four sections on the page.
### The "_Install_" button.
If you click it, you will be asked in which web you want to create a copy of this topic.
Install a copy in the Sandbox web and see what happens.  `cat data/Sandbox/ExampleType.txt`{{execute}}.
You created a stub pointing to the Applications/ExampleApp.ExampleType in the Sandbox with the name ExampleType!!

### The "Documentation" section
This section serves to document what the ExampleType is for and how it is implemented. We will see some examples shortly
