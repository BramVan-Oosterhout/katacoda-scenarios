Congratulations! You have seen some of the tools used to build a wiki
application.

As pointed out during the course there are alternative ways to build
this application. Feel free to experiment.

Presentation is a big part of a successful application and styling can
help a lot to achieve that. In this course we used the `pattern` skin,
because it displays many links useful in developing applications. As you
have seen in the development of the
[NotePadApp](NotePadApp.html "Create this topic"), few are needed in the
operation of a single app. A modern looking skin, the `nat` skin is more
attractive for end users and you should try the
[NotePadApp](NotePadApp.html "Create this topic") with `SKIN=nat`

Applications can be distributed via the Foswiki site as contributions,
`Contrib`s for short. See: [Foswiki
BuildContribCookbook](https://foswiki.org/Development.BuildContribCookbook).
Packaging is a topic in itself. If you are interested, post a request in
the Foswiki discussion group: <https://lists.foswiki.org/wws/lists>
using email to: <foswiki-discuss@lists.foswiki.org>.

Happy experimentation!
