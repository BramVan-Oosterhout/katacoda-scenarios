There are several tutorials available that describe starting out with Katacoda. A descriptive one:
* _A descriptive one:_ <https://lucasjellema.medium.com/creating-a-katacoda-scenario-10bf7b82b234>
* _A Katacoda scenario:_ <https://katacoda.com/scenario-examples/scenarios/create-scenario-101>

In this course I will present some techniques i have found useful when building a course based on a web product. Techniques that you can find in the decumentation or examples. Without some awareness of the need fo these techniques, you can encounter some baffling behaviour. This course may help you avoid those pitfalls.

This scenario summarises the introductions and sets up the environment for experimetation in the subsequent scenarios.

There are four parts to this scenario:
1. Setting up a git repository for the scenario
1. Creating the scenario
1. Configuring GitHub and Katacoda
1. Deploying the scenario to GitHub/Katacoda

References will provide more extensive examples.
