To get started with Katacoda, it is most convenient to have a basic course with one scenario up and running.

In this course we build on the example scenario created in the Preamble and go beyond that point to introduces the major steps in creating a more complex Katacoda scenario.

The scenario takes you through the creation of the components required for a tutorial covering the use of a web application, and presents some approaches that are productive when the course covers a larger application.

The following development steps are presented:
1. Prepare the image. assets/...dck
1. define the background startup : setup.sh
1. define the foreground wait: wait.sh
1. create (empty) answer: assets/answer.pl
1. create the basic scenario infrastructure: index.json
1. Create the Exercises and Solutions webs
1. Populate the Solutions web
1. setup assets/prepAssets.pl and prepare the assets
1. complete the scenario
1. complete assets/answer.pl
