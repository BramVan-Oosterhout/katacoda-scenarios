We can use the answer script to present larger examples of activities on demand. For example:

Create a new step in the `example` scenario. The step demonstrates the behaviour of the Foswiki Filter plugin.

1. insert step02 in example/index.json
1. create the content of example/step02.md
  * install Filter plugin, demostrate it's use, show the solution
1. create the example/assets/solutions.tgz file and add to the assets in example/index.json
1. create the example/assets/answer.pl and add to the assets in example/index.json

The content of each of these files is available in /tmp for this course.
