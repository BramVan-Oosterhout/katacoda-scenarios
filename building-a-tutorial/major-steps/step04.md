Now that we have the parts together, we can complete the initial scenario and deploy it to Katacoda.

## Task	

For the scenario we need to complete the `~/katacoda-tutorial/first-course/example/index.json`{{open}} file.

* Add `setup.sh` and execute it as a _background_ job to the `intro` step
* Add `wait.sh` and execute it as a _foreground_ job to the `intro` step
* Add `example-course.dck` to the assets and include it in the asset list
