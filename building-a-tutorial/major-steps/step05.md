To deploy the course material developed in the previous step, you need to:

* Add the new components to the local repository
  * `git add *`{{execute}}
  * `git commit -m "web exercise 0.1"`{{execute}}
* And push the repository to GitHub
  * `git push origin master`{{execute}}

Now (if your webhook is installed) you can view your updated scenario in Katacoda!

<div style="background-color: khaki">**Note:** If you have worked through this scenario before, your GitHub repo may be out of sync with the local repo. You will get a message like: _error: failed to push some refs_ and _hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...')_. This is easily resolved.
 Go back to step1 and follow the instructions in the Solution under _Resetting your GitHub repo_. </div>
