That completes Scenario 4, the use of meta data.
You can navigate to any of the following scenarios from this page. Or click _Next Scenario_ and return to the tutorial home page.

---++ Part 1 - Foswiki overview

Scenario 1 - [[https://www.katacoda.com/bramvanoosterhout/courses/foswiki/introduction][Introduction]]
Presents the operation of Foswiki out of the box as seen through the user interface.
Although there is much functionality under the hood, the immediately visible capabilities are essentially the entry of text in topics
and the searching across previously entered text.

Scenario 2 - [[https://www.katacoda.com/bramvanoosterhout/courses/foswiki/webs][Webs]]
Present the basic data management feature,
the possibility to divide the wiki content in broad classifications: the web. Webs are a basic component in the maintenance and creation of applications.
Webs, sub-webs and the relation between them are fundamental.

Scenario 3 - [[https://www.katacoda.com/bramvanoosterhout/courses/foswiki/macros][Macros]]
Presents the use of data definitions to control presentation and behaviour of Foswiki topics.
Macros are the cornerstones of the functioning of Foswiki applications and this chapter presents the mechanisms used.

Scenario 4 - [[https://www.katacoda.com/bramvanoosterhout/courses/foswiki/meta][Meta data]]
Presents the implementation of structured data with each topic. This data is referred to as Meta data
and can be entered and manipulated separate from the text content of the wiki topic.

Scenario 5 - [[https://www.katacoda.com/bramvanoosterhout/courses/foswiki/templates][Templates]] 
Presents templates. Foswiki templates define the format and presentation of the topic content.
Templates support wholesale changes to the appearance of a Foswiki site.

Scenario 6 - [[https://www.katacoda.com/bramvanoosterhout/courses/foswiki/extensions][Extensions]] 
Presents the use of extensions and their interface with the topic content. There are hundreds of plugins shipped with Foswiki.
This scenario demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality.

Your Katacoda environment for this scenario has been removed!>>> /home/bram/devfoswiki/core/working/TutorialPlugin/tutorialmd/katacoda-scenarios/foswiki1/meta/intro.md
Welcome to your Katacoda Foswiki tutorial environment!

Meta data is an integral part of the Foswiki data structure. There is some meta data associated with every topic.
In this scenario we will explore the meta data implementation supported by Foswiki.

<div style="background-color: khaki; font-size: smaller">
The Katacoda training environment is somewhat out of the ordinary. This setup installs Foswiki, listening at port 80 for the http protocol.
Access is through the katacoda-services host, which is accessible with the https protocol.
This leads to a mixed access scenario, which is by default not allowed in modern browsers.
For Firefox  you need to turn off all mixed content checking in
[[https://docs.sdl.com/LiveContent/content/en-US/SDL%20Web-v5/GUID-A96F0612-53DE-4E35-AE09-48D57146D6E4][about:config]]
<p />
*Please note* that you are <code>root</code>on the server.
If you are not a user with root privileges, some commands will need to be <code>sudo'ed</code>.

Run the following command and check the Sandbox.SolutionMetaDataStep1 page.

<code>tar xvzf /root/SolutionMetaData.tgz -C /var/www/foswiki/data/Sandbox --wildcards SolutionMetaDataStep1*`{{execute}}>>> /home/bram/devfoswiki/core/working/TutorialPlugin/tutorialmd/katacoda-scenarios/foswiki1/meta/step1.md
---++ _Meta data_
Meta data is usually displayed in a form format and can be edited in that same format.
The meta data for each topic (like Creation date, Author and so on) is collected in the topic _.txt_ file.
You can see this by opening a topic with the _?raw=debug_ parameter, which displays the TML and meta data for the topic in a Foswiki formatted page.

You find an example in [[https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/foswiki/Sandbox/MetaDataStep1][Sandbox.MetaDataStep1]]

Instead of _?raw=debug_ you can use _?raw=all_ url parameter to see the raw text of the topic in the browser window
instead of inside a Foswiki formatted page..

When you inspect the topic with either url parameter, you will see two extra lines at the top. They are the meta data associated with this topic:
<verbatim>
  %META:TOPICINFO{author="JoeBlog" comment="" date="1456896969" format="1.1" reprev="1" version="1"}%
  %META:TOPICPARENT{name="WebHome"}%
<verbatim>
Meta data is recorded using the same syntax as a macro.
The macro starts with _%META:_ followed by the meta data name (like: _TOPICINFO_),
followed by the value(s) recorded with that item as _name="value"_ pairs.

The following is standard meta data added in the life cycle of a Foswiki topic:

| *meta data* | *added when:* |
|-------------|---------------|
| META:TOPICINFO |the topic is created. The topic info is maintained as the topic is updated |
| META:TOPICPARENT |the parent is changed using: _More topic actions > Set new topic parent_ |
| META:TOPICMOVED |the topic is moved using _More topic actions > Rename or move topic_ |
| META:FILEATTACHMENT |a file is attached to the topic |
| META:PREFERENCE |using _More topic actions > Edit topic preference settings_ |

The table above presents the circumstances when the meta data is created by Foswiki as part of actions in the user interface.
You can add meta data to a topic by typing the correct entry directly into the editor.
The percent (in _%META_) must be in column 1 for the meta data to be recognised.

>>> /home/bram/devfoswiki/core/working/TutorialPlugin/tutorialmd/katacoda-scenarios/foswiki1/meta/step2-answer.md
Run the following command and check the Sandbox.SolutionMetaDataStep2 page.

<code>tar xvzf /root/SolutionMetaData.tgz -C /var/www/foswiki/data/Sandbox --wildcards SolutionMetaDataStep2*`{{execute}}>>> /home/bram/devfoswiki/core/working/TutorialPlugin/tutorialmd/katacoda-scenarios/foswiki1/meta/step2.md
---++ _Forms and Fields_
There are two additional meta properties that are related to user data. They are referred to as the form and the fields:

| *meta data* | *added when:* |
|-------------|---------------|
| META:FORM |Specifies the topic that defines the fields and properties. Forms can be added to a topic through the user interface, _if_ the form topic is listed in the WEBFORMS preference for the web.   |
| META:FIELD |Records the field value when assigned. Fields are defined in the form topic referred in the META:FORM data. |

By convention the form topic has a name ending with _Form_. When you search the System web for the topic title containing _Form_,
you will find several topics. There are some examples in the 
[[https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/foswiki/Sandbox/MetaDataStep2][Sandbox.MetaDataStep2]]
 topic.
   
At the bottom of the PreferencesPlugin debug display, you see the meta data in the topic, followed by the displayed form.

PackageForm is defined as the form supporting a topic by the following meta data entry in the topic:
  %META:FORM{ name="PackageForm" }%

The form topic usually resides in the same web as the topics that are supported by the form.
If the form topic is located in a different web from the topics supported by the form, the form topic name must be fully qualified with the web.
Like: _System.PackageForm_.

The content of the form topic _must_ contain a table that defines the fields of the form. The table format is:

| *Name* |the name of the field |
|---------|--------|
| *Type* |the type of the field like =checkbox, date, select= etc. |
| *Size* |The width (in characters) for display and data entry |
| *Values* |The predefined input for checkboxes, radio buttons and dropdown lists |
| *Description* |A description of the field |
| *Attributes* |Mandatory (M) and/or hidden (H) |
| *Default* |Value assigned on creation of the field |

Take a look at the PackageForm form definition  the topic linked in the
[[https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-80-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/foswiki/Sandbox/MetaDataStep2][Sandbox.MetaDataStep2]]
 topic.
<verbatim>
| *Name:* | *Type:* | *Size:* | *Values:* | *Tooltip message:* |
| Author | text | 60 | | |
| Version | text | 60 | | Numerical version number e.g. 1.2 |
| Release | text | 60 | | Release identifier (usually the date) |
| Description | text | 60 | | one line description of the module |
