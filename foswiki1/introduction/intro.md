Welcome to your Katacoda Foswiki tutorial environment!

In this scenario you will get a quick tour around the Foswiki web interface. You will try the navigation tools and get an overview of the directory structure supporting the implementation. You will create a new topic, edit text and attach a file.

Feel free to experiment. You cannot do any damage. Worst case you can restart the scenario!
