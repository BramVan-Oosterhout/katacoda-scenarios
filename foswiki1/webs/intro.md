Welcome to your Katacoda Foswiki tutorial environment!

In this scenario we will explore webs. Foswiki stores topic data in webs. Users can create webs for different type of data. Foswiki uses the System web to maintain its internal structure and documentation. There is a Sandbox web for experimentation. Users can create new webs and sub webs if so desired.
