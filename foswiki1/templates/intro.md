Welcome to your Katacoda Foswiki environment!

Foswiki topic text is presented in the browser inside a container that is referred to as: the skin. The skin is defined through a collection of files and topics that contain a mixture of html, TML, and macros. These files and topics are referred to as template files and template topics, templates for short.

In this scenario we will explore the template mechanism supported by Foswiki.  Warning: Can't find topic “KatacodaCourses.IntroFooter”
