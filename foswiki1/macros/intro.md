Welcome to your Katacoda Foswiki tutorial environment!

Foswiki uses a simple syntax to influence the presentation of the text entered in the wiki. All words starting and ending with a percent (%) character are potential candidates for translation. For instance ScenarioIntro is translated into the topic name. All Foswiki translation can be viewed as a text manipulation. Collectively these constructs are referred to as macros, but there are some semantic constructs that distinguish them as variables, preferences or macros.
