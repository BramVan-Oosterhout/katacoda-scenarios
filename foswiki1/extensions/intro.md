Welcome to your Katacoda Foswiki environment!

The Foswiki architecture consists of core functionality and is augmented by extensions. Extensions come in three major flavours:
* Skins - this are extensions that are implemented using the skin template files and topics discussed in the previous chapter
* Plugins - interact with the with the core functionality, using the Foswiki API, and are invoked through Foswiki macros
* Contributions - Contribs for short. This are collections of topics and perl scripts that are broader in scope than the plugin

This chapter presents an introduction to plugins. <div class="katacoda_tutorial" style="background-color: khaki">**Please note** that you are `root` on the server. If you are not a user with `root` privileges, some commands will need to be `sudo'ed`. </div>
