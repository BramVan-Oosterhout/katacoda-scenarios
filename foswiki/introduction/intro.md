Welcome to your Katacoda Foswiki tutorial environment!

In this scenario you will get a quick tour around the Foswiki web interface.
You will try the navigation tools and get a quick overview of the directory structure supporting the implementation.
You will create a new topic, edit text and attach a file.

Feel free to experiment. You cannot do any damage. Worst case you will restart the scenario!

The Katacoda training environment is somewhat out of the ordinary. This setup installs Foswiki, listening at port 80 for the http protocol.
Access is through the katacoda-services host, which is accessible with the https protocol.
This leads to a mixed access scenario, which is by default not allowed in modern browsers.
For Firefox  you need to turn off all mixed content checking in

**Please note** that you are `root`on the server.
If you are not a user with root privileges, some commands will need to be `sudo'ed`.
