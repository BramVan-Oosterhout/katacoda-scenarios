# katacoda-scenarios


Katacoda is no longer free. See: https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/leveraging-katacoda-technology.html

I am in the process of converting these scenarios to Killercoda. See: https://killercoda.com/bramvo.

So far none of the scenarios work fully. But the transfer looks hopeful and the performance is reasonable. Better than Katacoda last I tried it.
